This is an Art Gallery web application developed by a team of three members
(Johann Lee, Kelvin Ng and Ryan Koroh) for the purposes of the 1st part of
their RSD2 Semester 1 Web Application assignment.

This web application is designed to be an Art Gallery, which currently
offers the following features:

- Register an artist/customer account
- Upload and sell artpieces as an artist
- View artpieces
- Buy artpieces as a customer

In order to run this application, the user opens the project in Visual Studio,
and selects to run it. The application will start up, and automatically redirect
to the landing page (Home.aspx). (If this the redirect is not automatic, right-click
the project, select the 'Web' option, and under 'Start Action', select 'Specific
Page' and enter 'Pages/Home.aspx'.) From there the rest of the web application and
its features that are currently in place can be accessed.
