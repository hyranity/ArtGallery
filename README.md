Dev notes! ~ by Ryan
- When opening a project existing on PC using VS, open by 'Project/Solution' and select the .csproj file. It's usually in a sub-folder going by the same name as its parent.
- To create an SQL server, do Add Item > SQL Server. (Trying to create one through 'Connect to Database' will usually result in some bullshit Error 40 stuff.)
- For instructions regarding syncing the repo with local versions, refer to Johann's message in the group.
- Don't mess shit up lol
